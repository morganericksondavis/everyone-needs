Needs subwoofer to hear bass properly; beat is crude. Here's what I
think:

Beat should start in with gusto after the bass build. Can you bam up a
catchy one? Probably shouldn't be too abstract - maybe dancey? Then I'm
going to use the intro as sort of a mid-ground melody off which to base
subsequent verse; may also serve as a refrain. We'll see... have fun!
